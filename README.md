A repository for models of local election results at local authority level. The only model I've got so far is written in Stan - analysis is in Python in a Jupyter notebook.

To run the notebook you'll need to have the following python packages installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pystan

The notebook downloads most of the data it needs directly, but unfortunately this wasn't possible in every single case. Y
